# gradient-and-robert-operator_IPMV
The gradient is a vector operation that measures the change in intensity of an image. It is used to highlight regions of an image where there are rapid intensity changes, which are typically edges or boundaries between different regions.
The Robert Operator is one of the simplest edge detection operators, used to find edges in an image by computing the gradient in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

The Robert operator works by applying a pair of 2x2 convolution kernels to the image. These kernels are used to approximate the gradient at each pixel.
